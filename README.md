The art is simple to interact with, you click on one of the four squares and it fills with a random color each time. 
If you click and drag the mouse, the fill will follow, still filling hichever square the mouse is hovering over.

It is very simplistic, but it took me quite awhile to understand what I was doing and where it affected it, hopefully the process work can show that I ran into wuite a few minor and some major issues, as I had trouble making commits the whole time.
